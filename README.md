# Stock-Market-Prediction

In this project, we aim to support beginner investors by effectively predicting stock
values and trends. By analyzing historical data, we will develop a model to predict
the closing prices of stocks. This will benefit new investors, including recent graduates,
in making informed investment decisions and reducing the risk of failed investments.
Our model will also provide visual representations of the data, aiding in data
interpretation. The ultimate goal is to empower investors with accurate predictions
and visual insights, ensuring their success in the stock market.
